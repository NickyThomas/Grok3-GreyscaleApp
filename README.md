# Greyscale App

## How it works
* Upload a Photo: Click the "Upload Photo" button to select an image from your device.
* Slider Control: Move the slider (0 to 100) to adjust the greyscale intensity. At 0%, the image remains in full color; at 100%, itâ€™s fully greyscaled.
* Real-Time Update: The image updates dynamically as you move the slider, blending the original colors with the greyscale version.

## Requirements
Install the required libraries by running:
* pip install pillow numpy tkinter
* Python 3.x must be installed on your system.

## How to use
* Upload: Click "Upload Photo" to load an image.
* Edit: Adjust the greyscale and contrast sliders to modify the image.
* Save: Click "Save Image" to export your edited photo.
